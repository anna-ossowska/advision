Advision is an elegant and business looking website tailored for the consulting company.

During the development phase, I paid special attention to creating a scalable and maintainable front-end architecture. The website also contains many reusable CSS components which results in consistent ‘look and feel’ across all pages.

For the Advision project I used various advanced CSS features including Flexbox, animations and media queries, created an interactive image gallery, as well as a custom contact form with Netlify.

It is important to emphasize that the website is fully responsive, so the potential users can view the content on their phones, computers and tablets.
